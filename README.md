## Support chat

As a full-fledged application, we decided that we needed our users to be able to connect with our team and offer something new and interesting.

[TG-bot](https://t.me/lyesplyebot)


For this purpose, we have implemented a telegram bot in which <span style="color:purple">users*</span> can rate our application according to three criteria, leave a review and write to technical support to receive feedback

There are also some bonuses, one of which is on your birthday! ðŸŽ‚

<span style="color:purple">*to use tg-bot you must register in the application</span>


## Human evoluation
